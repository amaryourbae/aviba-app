# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The **aviba-app (codeguide-starter-fullstack)** is a pre-configured full-stack web application starter template built on Next.js 15. It offers out-of-the-box user authentication, a protected dashboard, modern UI components, dark-mode theming, and a containerized PostgreSQL setup. By bundling these core building blocks, it dramatically reduces the time and effort required to kick off new web projects that need secure user accounts, a data-driven interface, and a production-ready environment.

This template exists to solve the common problem of spending weeks on boilerplate: setting up auth, database connections, theming, and deployment scaffolding. Its key objectives are:

- Provide a secure, type-safe authentication system backed by Better Auth and Drizzle ORM.
- Showcase a protected dashboard layout that developers can extend with real data.
- Deliver a polished, accessible UI built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS.
- Enable dark mode out of the box, respecting system preferences and user toggles.
- Offer Docker support for PostgreSQL and best practices (ESLint, Prettier) for code quality and deployment readiness (e.g., Vercel).

Success criteria include:

- A developer can clone the repo, run `docker-compose up` and `npm run dev`, and have a working auth + dashboard in under five minutes.
- Authentication flows (sign-up, sign-in, protected routes) work correctly, with type safety enforced by TypeScript and Drizzle.
- UI components render consistently in light and dark modes, passing basic accessibility checks.
- The project passes linting and formatting rules without manual fixes.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope (First Version)

- Email/password user registration and login via Better Auth.
- Protected `/dashboard` route only accessible to authenticated users.
- Static dashboard content pulled from a local `data.json` file.
- UI built with shadcn/ui components, styled by Tailwind CSS v4.
- Dark mode support via `next-themes`, with auto-detect and manual toggle.
- Type-safe database schema for users and sessions using Drizzle ORM.
- Local database provisioning via Docker Compose with PostgreSQL.
- Code quality enforcement using ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- Deployment-ready configuration for platforms like Vercel.

### Out-of-Scope (Planned for Future Phases)

- Dynamic, database-driven dashboard data queries and mutations.
- Password reset and email verification flows.
- Social/OAuth logins (e.g., Google, GitHub).
- Comprehensive logging, metrics, and monitoring integration.
- Automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- CI/CD pipeline setup (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- Advanced caching or performance optimizations beyond Next.js defaults.
- Internationalization (i18n) support.

## 3. User Flow

When a new visitor arrives, they land on the public homepage. From there, they see clear navigation links for **Sign Up** and **Sign In**. Clicking **Sign Up** brings up a form where they enter email and password. On successful registration, the user is automatically logged in and redirected to the **Dashboard**.

Authenticated users land on a layout that includes a **Site Header** (with logo and theme toggle) and a left **Sidebar** for navigation. The main content area shows dashboard cards, charts, and tables sourced from `data.json`. Users can switch between light and dark themes via the toggle in the header, and they can sign out using a button in the header or sidebar. If an unauthenticated user tries to access `/dashboard`, they are redirected to **Sign In**, preserving the intended destination.

## 4. Core Features

- **Authentication Module**: Email/password sign-up, sign-in, session management with Better Auth and Next.js API routes.
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware or route guards to restrict access to authenticated users only.
- **Dashboard Layout**: Pre-built dashboard page with static JSON data, illustrating cards (`section-cards.tsx`), interactive charts (`chart-area-interactive.tsx`), and data tables (`data-table.tsx`).
- **UI Component Library**: shadcn/ui components (`button.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`, etc.) customized via Tailwind CSS.
- **Theming & Dark Mode**: Automatic system theme detection plus manual toggle, powered by `next-themes` and CSS variables.
- **Type-Safe Database**: Drizzle ORM schemas for `users` and `sessions`, with a centralized `db/index.ts` connection.
- **Dockerized Database**: `docker-compose.yml` to spin up PostgreSQL locally.
- **Code Quality Tools**: ESLint for linting, Prettier for formatting, TypeScript for type checking.
- **Deployment Config**: Ready-for-use Next.js settings optimized for hosting platforms (e.g., Vercel).

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components, next-themes.
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Better Auth (self-hosted), Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL.
- **DevOps & Containers**: Docker & Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL, Vercel for production deploy.
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript compiler.
- **Potential IDE Integrations**: VS Code with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, ESLint, Prettier plugins.

_No AI models are integrated in this version._

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Initial page load time under 1 second on 3G; subsequent navigations via client-side transitions.
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling of Next.js instances; PostgreSQL can be hosted on managed service.
- **Security**: All API endpoints accessible only over HTTPS; password storage via bcrypt (managed by Better Auth); CSRF protection via Next.js defaults; CORS disabled by default.
- **Accessibility**: Aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; use semantic HTML, focus management, and ARIA roles in shadcn/ui components.
- **Usability**: Responsive design for mobile/desktop; intuitive sidebar navigation and theme toggle.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target in production; automated health checks for database connection.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- Requires Node.js v18+ and Docker installed for local development.
- PostgreSQL version locked to the image in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., 15.x).
- Better Auth API must be available and configured via environment variables in `.env`.
- Assumes developers are familiar with Next.js App Router conventions and TypeScript.
- No legacy browser support beyond evergreen browsers.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **Static Data Source**: Dashboard uses a local JSON file. Forgetting to replace this with live queries could lead to stale displays. _Mitigation_: Create placeholder API routes and Drizzle queries early.
- **API Route Growth**: As features grow, the `/app/api` folder may become cluttered. _Mitigation_: Plan subdirectories (e.g., `/api/users`, `/api/dashboard`).
- **Schema Migrations**: Drizzle ORM requires manual migrations; forgetting migrations can break schema. _Mitigation_: Adopt a migration tool or script early (e.g., Drizzle Migrate).
- **Docker Networking**: Misconfigured Docker host/port can block local dev. _Mitigation_: Document common fixes in `README.md`.
- **Dark Mode Flicker**: If `next-themes` is not initialized properly, users may see a flash of the wrong theme. _Mitigation_: Follow `next-themes` SSR best practices and include `ThemeProvider` in root layout.
- **Authentication Edge Cases**: Better Authâ€™s default error messages may be too generic. _Mitigation_: Catch and customize error responses in API routes.
